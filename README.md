# Password Generator (HTML/CSS/Javascript)

## Description
  I created a password generator using starter code and applied knowledge of Javascript to provide prompt and alert functionality. The program generates passwords of 8-128 characters, utilizing lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I learned how to properly use alerts/confirms, math.floor and math.random functions, as well as strings to simplify password creation in a few simple steps for the user.
  
## Installation & Usage

This program will create a new (mostly) random password for the user. First, the user is prompted to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Then, the user can decide if they'd prefer uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters to be included in the new password by selecting OK or Cancel respectively. Upon selecting the password attributes, the user is presented with a new password in the center textbox of the window.
